# `choo-express-ssr`

A simple SSR ready boilerplate for [Choo](https://github.com/choojs/choo)

Heavily inspired by [Firefox Send](https://github.com/mozilla/send)

## Install

After `git clone`

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

## Why

A lot of setups out there are ideal for client side only applications. 

But some projects require a backend server, thus this boilerplate project.
